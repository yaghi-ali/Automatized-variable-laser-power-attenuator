# Automatized-variable-laser-power-attenuator
The attenuator is based on a half waveplate and a polarizer: while the polarizer is fixed and transmits the p-polarization, the waveplate is housed in a motor-controlled 360° rotation mount and allows to continuously change the input linear polarization.
